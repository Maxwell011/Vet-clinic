# Vet Clinic

> For this project, I will use a relational database to create the data structure for a vet clinic. The database will hold tables holding information about the following: animals, animals' owners, clinic employees and visits.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database.
